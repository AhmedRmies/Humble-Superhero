### Collaboration
I would collaborate with a teammate by:
- Pair programming to solve complex problems.
- Conducting code reviews to ensure code quality.
- Discussing potential improvements and new features.

### If I Had More Time
If I had more time, I would:
- Add authentication and authorization to the API.
- Implement a proper database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- Add more advanced filtering and sorting options.
- Write more comprehensive tests for all endpoints.
